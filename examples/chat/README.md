Chat Server
===========
Demo long-polling chat server to test the connection manager.

Usage
-----
Edit chat.go and set the WEBROOT to the absolute path of the webroot/
directory. Search for 8080 if you want to change to another port.

Run chat on your server or localhost (see note about security, below).

Point a browser to http://localhost:8080/ (or whichever host you have it
running on.)
